Physher is a maximum likelihood-based method for estimating evolutionary rates and divergence times from genetic data. The simplest model assumes that the substitution rate is constant over the whole phylogeny (strict clock model). Alternatively, rate variation among lineages can be taken into account using two different parameterisations: local and discrete clocks.
